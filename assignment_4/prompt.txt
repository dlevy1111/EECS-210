Assignment:  
• You may use any language you want, but if you want help from me or one of the 
SIs, you should probably use C++ or Python. 
• Use the methods or functions inherent in the language and/or using methods or 
functions you create. Like previous assignments, don’t “hard code” a solution you 
did on paper as the output. 
• Create a program for the following: 
1. Write code that determines if a relation (R) of ordered pairs is reflexive or not 
& then if it is not, finds the reflexive closure of R (R*). The output should be: 
a) R = {...} 
b) R is or is not reflexive 
c) R* if it is not reflexive 
d) Show the code works for the relation {(1,1), (4,4), (2,2), (3,3)} on the 
set {1,2,3,4}. 
e) Show the code works for the relation {(a,a), (c,c)} on the set {a,b,c,d}. 
2. Write code that determines if a relation (R) of ordered pairs is symmetric or 
not & then if it is not, finds the symmetric closure of R (R*). The output 
should be: 
a) R = {...} 
b) R is or is not symmetric 
c) R* if it is not symmetric 
d) Show the code works for the relation {(1,2), (4,4), (2,1), (3,3)} on the 
set {1,2,3,4}. 
e) Show the code works for the relation {(1,2), (3,3)} on the set 
{1,2,3,4}. 
3. Write code that determines if a relation (R) of ordered pairs is transitive or not 
& then if it is not, finds the transitive closure of R (R*) using Warshall’s 
Algorithm. The output should be: 
a) R = {...} 
b) R is or is not transitive 
c) R* if it is not transitive 
d) Show the code works for the relation {(a,b), (d,d), (b,c), (a,c)} on the 
set {a,b,c,d}. 
e) Show the code works for the relation {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2)} on 
the set {1,2,3}. 
4. Write code that determines if a relation (R) of ordered pairs is an equivalence 
relation or not and the reason why. The output should be: 
a) R = {...} 
b) R is or is not an equivalence relation 
c) The reasons why, if it is not an equivalence relation (i.e., it is not 
reflexive, and/or it is not symmetric, and/or it is not transitive). 
d) Show the code works for the relation {(1,1),(2,2),(2,3)} on the set 
{1,2,3}. 
e) Show the code works for the relation {(a,a),(b,b),(c,c),(b,c),(c,b)} on 
the set {a,b,c}. 
5. Write code that determines if a relation (R) of ordered pairs is a poset of the 
set (S) or not and the reason why. The output should be: 
a) S = {...} 
b) R = {...} 
c) (S,R) is or is not a poset 
d) The reason why, if it is not poset (i.e., it is not reflexive, and/or it is 
not antisymmetric, and/or it is not transitive. 
e) Show the code works for the relation {(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,3), (4,1), 
(4,2), (4,4)} on the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. 
f) Show the code works for the relation {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 
0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 3)} on the set {0, 1, 2, 3}.
